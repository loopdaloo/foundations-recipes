    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>¼ cup lemon juice</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon Dijon mustard </li>
                <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
                <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>⅛ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
                <li>4 skin-on, bone-in chicken thighs</li>
                <li>4 lemon wedges</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Whisk lemon juice, olive oil, Dijon mustard, garlic, salt, and pepper together in a bowl. Set marinade aside.</li>
                <li>Place chicken thighs into a large resealable plastic bag. Pour marinade over chicken and seal bag, making sure to cover all parts of chicken. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours.</li>
                <li>Preheat an air fryer to 360 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
                <li>Remove chicken from marinade and pat dry with paper towels. Place chicken pieces in the air fryer basket, cooking in batches if necessary.</li>
                <li>Fry until chicken is no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, 22 to 24 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Squeeze a lemon wedge over each piece upon serving.</li>
            </ol>
